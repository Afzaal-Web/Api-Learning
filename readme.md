/* API (Application Programming Interface) lets two programs talk to each other. In our case:
You send a request to https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
It sends back a random dog image in this format:
{
  "message": "https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/hound-afghan/n02088094_1003.jpg",
  "status": "success"
}
